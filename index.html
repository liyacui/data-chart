<p>So far this year, 26 people have died in traffic collisions while riding a bike or e-bike in New York City, the second highest number since 40 cyclists were killed in 1999.</p>

<p>The number of cyclists injured in traffic collisions has not spiked—4,600 in 2023, which is consistent with recent years.</p>

<p>Many of the city’s cyclists are pointing to a lack of bike infrastructure as one of the causes. According to bike advocacy group <a href="https://projects.transalt.org/bikelanes#smp">Transportation Alternatives</a>, only 27.8 miles of protected bike lanes have been built in 2023, although the city was required to install at least 50 miles this year under the NYC Streets Plan.</p>

<p>What kinds of vehicles are cyclists most likely to crash with? It’s not large trucks, city buses, or speedy motorcycles. The vast majority are sedans, station wagons, and SUVs, common cars often driven by other civilians.</p>

<p>New York City-based bike advocacy groups like Transportation Alternatives, Bike New York, NYC Bike Bus, and Uptown & Boogie Bicycle Advocacy did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
